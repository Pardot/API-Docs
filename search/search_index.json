All up-to-date documentation of Pardot's official API is housed here. A few things to note: To get answers to your questions about the API, or report a documentation issue, open a ticket with our Support team. Learn how . Getting Started If you're new to using Pardot APIs, see our getting started guide . Pardot API Versions Versions 3 and 4 If your Pardot account has the Allow Multiple Prospects with the Same Email Address (AMPSEA) feature disabled, use version 3 of the Pardot API. If your Pardot account has AMPSEA enabled, use version 4 of the Pardot API. Versions 3 and 4 provide the same functionality, using slightly different input and output syntax to support working with prospects that share an email address. See Version 3 and 4 Overview for information about using versions 3 and 4. Version 5 Version 5 provides new functionality. You can use this version whether or not your Pardot account has \"Allow Multiple Prospects with the Same Email Address\" enabled. See Version 5 Overview for information about using version 5. Test and Production Environments Different Pardot environments are hosted on different domains, and you must use the correct domain in your request URLs. In general: Demos, developer orgs, and sandbox environments are hosted on the domain pi.demo.pardot.com . Training and production environments are hosted on the domain pi.pardot.com . You can find the correct URL for your Pardot domain from Salesforce Setup. In Salesforce, click the gear icon to access Setup. From Setup, enter Installed Packages in the Quick Find box, and then select Installed Packages . Find the package b2bmaIntegration . If the namespace prefix is \"b2bma\", use the domain pi.pardot.com in your request URLs. If the namespace prefix is \"pi3\", use the domain pi.demo.pardot.com in your request URLs. Rate Limits We enforce API rate limits in two ways: daily requests concurrent requests Daily Requests Pardot Pro customers are allocated 25,000 API requests a day. Pardot Ultimate customers can make up to 100,000 API requests a day. These limits reset at the beginning of the day based on your account time zone settings. Any request made exceeding the limits result in an error code 122 You can check your current daily usage on the \"usage and limits\" page. Concurrent Requests To interact with our API more efficiently, you can have up to five concurrent API requests. Any connection over five results in an error code 66 response. Open Source API wrappers These wrappers aren't officially supported, but are available to use with the Pardot API. ruby-pardot python-pypardot4 for version 4 of the API pardot-java-client","title":"Official Pardot API Documentation"},{"location":"#official-pardot-api-documentation","text":"Welcome!

Through the API, you can perform several common operations on Pardot objects including the following: create -- Creates an object with the specified parameters. read -- Retrieves information about the specified object. query -- Retrieves objects that match specified criteria. update -- Updates elements of an existing object. upsert -- Updates elements of an existing object if it exists. If the object does not exist, one is created using the supplied parameters. You must authenticate using a Salesforce OAuth endpoint. See Authentication for more. Keep a few considerations in mind when you perform requests. For update requests, only the fields specified in the request are updated. All others are left unchanged. If a required field is cleared during an update , the request is declined. Request Format All requests to the API: Must use either HTTP GET or POST Must pass the access token. Must pass Pardot Business Unit ID in an HTTP Pardot-Business-Unit-Id header (obtained using Salesforce OAuth) to authenticate. Must use the correct URL for your Pardot environment. See Test and Production Environments . Sample GET Request These examples use a production environment, so the domain is pi.pardot.com . If you are using a test environment, your domain is pi.demo.pardot.com . See Test and Production Environments . GET https://pi.pardot.com/api/<object>/version/3/do/<op>/<id_field>/<id>?<params> HTTP/1.1 Authorization: Bearer <access_token> Pardot-Business-Unit-Id: <pardot_business_unit_id> Sample POST Request POST https://pi.pardot.com/api/<object>/version/3/do/<op>/<id_field>/<id> HTTP/1.1 Authorization: Bearer <access_token> Pardot-Business-Unit-Id: <pardot_business_unit_id> <params> Request Parameters Parameter Required Description object X The object type to be returned by the API request op X The operation to be performed on the specified object type id_field X The field to be used as the identifier for the specified object id X The identifier for the specified objects access_token X The access token obtained during Authentication pardot_business_unit_id X The Pardot business unit. For details see Authentication format The API data format: either xml (default) or json params Parameters specific to your request; See individual methods for details The ordering of parameters is arbitrary. Parameters are passed using conventional HTML parameter syntax, with '?' indicating the start of the parameter string (for GET requests only) and '&' as the separator between parameters. With the exception of <format> and <params> , all components are required. Data returned from the API is formatted using JSON or XML 1.0 with UTF-8 character encoding. Keep in mind that some characters in the response can be encoded as HTML entities, requiring client-side decoding. Also, keep in mind that all parameters specified in an API request MUST be URL-encoded before they are submitted. In general, the API returns XML or JSON containing a current version of the target object's data. But unsuccessful requests return a short response containing an error code and message. See Error Codes & Messages for error descriptions and suggested remedies: kb/error-codes-messages Changing the API Response Format The Pardot API supports several output formats, and each returns different levels of detail in the XML or JSON response. Output formats are defined by specifying the output request parameter. Supported output formats include: full -- Returns all supported data for the Pardot object and all objects associated with it. simple -- Returns all supported data for the Pardot object. mobile -- Returns an abbreviated version of the object data. This output format is ideal for mobile applications. bulk -- Returns basic data for an object (does not provide total object count). Used for querying large amounts of data . If the output request parameter is not defined, the output format defaults to full . See the XML Response Format sections for each object for details about the formats. Sample Code Here's an example of calling the Pardot API using a simple PHP client using the cURL library. Note: We strongly recommend against using PHP's file_get_contents function to call the Pardot API because it makes error handling cumbersome. <?php /** * Class SamplePardotApiClient * * Example PHP client to call the Pardot API */ class SamplePardotApiClient { const BASE_URL = \"https://pi.pardot.com/api/\"; const SALESFORCE_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL = \"https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token\"; /** @var int $apiVersion */ private int $apiVersion; /** @var string $format */ private string $format; /** * SamplePardotApiClient constructor. * @param int $apiVersion * @param string $format */ public function __construct(int $apiVersion, string $format = 'xml') { $this->apiVersion = $apiVersion; $this->format = $format; } /** * @param string $endpoint * @param string $operation * @param array $data * @param array $headers * @param array $queryParams * @return array * @throws Exception */ public function post(string $endpoint, string $operation, $data = [], $headers = [], $queryParams = []) { $curl_handle = $this->initRequest($endpoint, $operation, $headers, $queryParams); curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_POST, true); // Add POST data if given if (!empty($data)) { curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data); } return $this->executeCall($curl_handle); } /** * @param string $endpoint * @param string $operation * @param array $headers * @param array $queryParams * @return array * @throws Exception */ public function get(string $endpoint, string $operation, $headers = [], $queryParams = []) { $curl_handle = $this->initRequest($endpoint, $operation, $headers, $queryParams); return $this->executeCall($curl_handle); } /** * @param string $endpoint * @param string $operation * @param array $headers * @param array $queryParams * @return false|resource */ private function initRequest(string $endpoint, string $operation, $headers = [], $queryParams = []) { // Construct our full URL to the Pardot API $url = $this->buildUrl($endpoint, $operation); // Add desired format to any query string params provided $queryParams['format'] = $this->format; // Build query string params into an encoded string $queryString = http_build_query($queryParams, null); // Append query string params to URL $url .= \"?{$queryString}\"; // Init curl handle and set standard curl options: timeouts / require SSL / verify SSL $curl_handle = curl_init($url); curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 5); curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 30); curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS, CURLPROTO_HTTPS); curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2); curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); // Add any headers passed in such as Authorization header if (!empty($headers)) { curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers); } return $curl_handle; } /** * @param string $endpoint * @param string $operation * @return string */ private function buildUrl(string $endpoint, $operation = \"\") { if ($endpoint === 'login') { return self::SALESFORCE_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL; } return self::BASE_URL . \"{$endpoint}/version/{$this->apiVersion}/do/{$operation}\"; } /** * @param $curl_handle * @return array * @throws Exception */ private function executeCall($curl_handle) { // Execute our call to the Pardot API $rsp = curl_exec($curl_handle); // Gather the HTTP response code and last effective URL called $httpCode = curl_getinfo($curl_handle, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE); $url = curl_getinfo($curl_handle, CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL); // Handle errors in calls, this could be a log or an exception thrown as written here if (!$rsp) { $errorMessage = curl_error($curl_handle); curl_close($curl_handle); throw new Exception(\"Error calling API.

Version 4 was created to accommodate multiple prospects with the same email address. If your Pardot org has the allow multiple prospects with the same email address (AMPSEA) feature enabled, then use version 4. If your Pardot org doesn\u2019t have AMPSEA enabled, use version 3. To determine if your Pardot org has AMPSEA enabled, check out this guide. Transitioning from Version 3 to Version 4 If you want to enable AMPSEA in your Pardot account, use the following guidelines to keep using Pardot APIs. Request Path Changes Update your requests to use the /version/4 path. For example: Before: GET: https://pi.pardot.com/api/prospect/version/3/read/id/1 After: GET: https://pi.pardot.com/api/prospect/version/4/read/id/1 Prospect API Changes Most of the differences between version 3 and version 4 are in the prospect APIs. New reference field: Prospects can be referenced using the Salesforce CRM Identifier, the fid field. This fid field refers to the ID of the Lead or Contact record in Salesforce. You can find the lead ID (begins with 00Q) or the contact ID (begins with 003) in the URL when viewing a lead or contact record. Or, you can get multiple contacts or lead ID from Salesforce using the export tool. Create: Prospects can still be created with a referenced email address. If you call the create API with the same email address multiple times, each call creates a prospect. Previously, you would get an error. Read: When making a read query, querying by email returns all prospects that share that email address. Querying by Pardot id or Salesforce fid only returns the one matching prospect. Update: Because there can be multiple prospects with the same email address, prospects can no longer be updated when referenced via email alone. Instead, use either the Pardot id or Salesforce fid references. Upsert: Upsert query by email always creates a prospect. Upsert by Pardot id or Salesforce fid updates or creates as needed. See Upserting Prospects for more details. Delete: Delete query must reference by Pardot id or Salesforce fid . Batch processing: See examples of batch processing in the Prospect object documentation. See the Prospect object documentation . Opportunity API Changes Create: Creating an opportunity using a prospect_email reference must correspond to an existing prospect. If there are multiple prospects with that email address, the prospect with the most recent activity date is used. If you want to apply the opportunity to a specific prospect, then reference the prospect using prospect_id . Query: If you query using a prospect_email reference, you receive opportunities that correspond with any prospects that share that email address. if you want a specific prospect then query by the prospect_id .

To set up a connected app for OAuth, the \"pardot_api\" scope must be one of the selected OAuth scopes. Otherwise, only the username-password OAuth flow can be used with the Pardot API. Check out this video for an example of how to implement OAuth. You must have the Pardot Business Unit ID that you are trying to authenticate with. From Marketing Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Pardot , and then select Pardot Account Setup . Your business unit ID begins with \"0Uv\" and is 18 characters long. If you can't access Pardot Account Setup, ask your Salesforce Administrator to give you the Pardot Business Unit ID. Authenticate with a user that is SSO-enabled. An SSO-enabled user is one who can log in to the Pardot user interface (https://pi.pardot.com) using \"Log In with Salesforce\" or who can access Pardot using the Pardot Lightning App. For more help with authentication, see our Getting Started guide. Obtain Salesforce Access Token To use Pardot APIs with an SSO user, you must first get a Salesforce access token. For simplicity, our example uses the username-password OAuth flow, but OAuth flow can be used to obtain an access token. In many use cases, other OAuth flows are more appropriate than username-password flow. For example, a web app with user interaction would likely use either user agent flow or web server flow. See Salesforce OAuth setup for details.

Visitor Activity with Export API When you need large amounts of visitor activity data, use the Export API. If you need a different object, see Query the Pardot API for details on how to retrieve the information using the query endpoint. The Export API is asynchronous and efficiently scales data retrieval based on the available resources. There are more server resources available for the Export API than the query endpoint, which provides faster results without hitting concurrency and API limits to process multiple queries. Before getting started, review the documentation for the Export API. Best Practice #1 - Polling for Status Updates Because export is asynchronous, you can poll the Read endpoint of the Export API to see if the export is done processing. The time an export takes depends on how much data is being exported and the resources available for processing. Because export times can vary, we recommend that you start by setting a polling interval between 30 seconds and a few minutes. If you run an integration regularly, set your polling intervals to the average of the time taken for a few runs of your integration. For example, if your integration runs daily and retrieves all visitor activity data for the previous day, start with a polling frequency of 1 minute. Note the export durations for a few days, then average those times to find a polling interval. In the example, over a few days you notice that your export finishes with an average duration of 15 minutes. Polling every minute is too often and polls 15 times. If you set the polling interval to 5 minutes, it polls three or four times. If you run integrations sporadically or infrequently, try increasing the polling interval over time. For example, if you track the number of times the integration has polled, you can calculate a gradually increasing polling interval using this function: ceil(((n * n)/5)+1) Where n is the index of the poll, starting with 0 Using this function to calculate polling interval, you poll a minute the first time, 2 minutes for the second and continue to increase at larger intervals each time. This process allows the integration to check frequently soon after an export is created to catch the quick running exports but also limit the number of polls for exports that are long-running. Remember that the Read endpoint of the Export API counts toward API limits, so these tips let you adjust how much of that limit is used by your integration. Best Practice #2 - Specify Limited Date Ranges Because the results of the export API are returned only after the query has executed, limiting the date range of the export returns results faster. A way limit date range is to break large date ranges into several smaller ranges. For example, it's OK to create an export to retrieve a year's worth of visitor activity within a single export by specifying a year duration, like the following. curl https://pi.pardot.com/api/export/version/3/do/create?format=json \\ --H Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN> \\ --H Pardot-Business-Unit-Id: <BUSINESS UNIT ID> -d '{ \"object\": \"visitorActivity\", \"procedure\": { \"name\": \"filter_by_created_at\", \"arguments\": { \"created_after\": \"2019-12-25 00:00:00\", \"created_before\": \"2020-12-25 00:00:00\" } } }' The issue is that all 12 months of data must be queried in order for the results to be returned. There are cases where your integration can use a smaller data set up front and be refined later as more data from the export becomes available. For example, an integration can work off the last month of data while waiting on a three-month range and then increasing to a twelve-month range. In this example, you could create three different exports with the three different ranges: Last month \"created_after\": \"2020-11-25 00:00:00\", \"created_before\": \"2020-12-25 00:00:00\" Three months prior \"created_after\": \"2020-08-25 00:00:00\", \"created_before\": \"2020-11-25 00:00:00\" Eight months prior \"created_after\": \"2019-12-25 00:00:00\", \"created_before\": \"2020-08-25 00:00:00\" Instead of waiting for all twelve months of data to be exported at once, the same data is returned in smaller increments, so you can see the newest data sooner. Query the Pardot API Pulling data from a query endpoint in the Pardot API is a straightforward, two-step process. First, log in with your Pardot user email, password, and user key to acquire an API key. Then, use the query endpoint for each data set to pull the data. Before getting started, review the documentation at http://developer.pardot.com and determine which data set you are going to pull. For a data set to be eligible for a bulk data pull, it must have a query operation that supports at least one of the following three sets of search filter criteria parameters: created_before and created_after updated_before and updated_after id_greater_than and id_less_than Issue an HTTP GET to the appropriate query endpoint to pull the data back. The query response contains up to 200 rows from the data set you have requested. Best Practice #1 \u2010 Use the Bulk Output Format For bulk data pulls, we strongly recommended that you use the bulk output format, which is highly optimized for performance. The bulk output format disables functionality that displays additional data in the API response such as nested object relationships (for example, campaign name for activities). Additionally, the bulk output format omits information about the total number of rows that matched your query, which enables the API to return a response more quickly. Best Practice #2 \u2010 Avoid Offset For bulk data pulls, we strongly discourage use of the offset parameter. Instead, iterate through the data set using one of the supported search filter criteria parameters. As you process the query results in your code, store a high water mark value like the largest id or most recent created_at or updated_at value. Then, on your next query, send that high water mark value as the id_greater_than , created_after , or updated_after search filter parameter value.

In this example, you query for all visitor activities that occurred yesterday. The created_after and created_before search filter criteria parameters are perfect for this use case. To keep things simple, assume there were a total of 5 activities created yesterday (at time of writing, 2016-03-29) at times 02:00, 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, and 18:00. Also assume the API page size limit is 2 rather than 200. To iterate over the results in the suggested approach, your API integration process would proceed as follows: 1. Log in to the Pardot API 2. Pull all visitor activity created after yesterday at midnight ( 2016-03-29T00:00:00 ) and before tonight at midnight ( 2016-03-30T00:00:00 ): Example Request & Response (JSON) curl https://pi.pardot.com/api/visitorActivity/version/3/do/query?output=bulk&format=json&created_after=2016-03-29T00:00:00&created_before=2016-03-30T00:00:00&sort_by=created_at&sort_order=ascending \\ --header Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN> \\ --header Pardot-Business-Unit-Id: <BUSINESS UNIT ID> { \"@attributes\": { \"stat\": \"ok\", \"version\": 1 }, \"result\": { \"visitor_activity\": [ { \"id\": 1000, \"created_at\": \"2016-03-29 02:00:00\" }, { \"id\": 1001, \"created_at\": \"2016-03-29 06:00:00\" }] } } Note : The example was edited for brevity. The API has returned two results - the activities from 02:00 and 06:00. Since you are paging by created_at , set your high water mark value to the created_at value of the last record you pull back, 2016-03-30T06:00:00 . You have now retrieved all activities up to that time.

The API returns two more results back - the activities from 10:00 and 14:00. Since you are paging by created_at , update your high water mark value to the created_at value of the last record you pull back, 2021-03-29T14:00:00 .

The API returns one result back, the activity from 18:00. As the max page size is 2 and the API returned one record, you know you are at the end of the list of records and do not need to query any further. If the API had returned 2 records you would repeat the query process again with a new high water mark.

The API returns one result back, the activity from 18:00. As the max page size is 2 and the API returned one record, you know you are at the end of the list of records and do not need to query any further. If the API had returned 2 records you would repeat the query process again with a new high water mark.

This tutorial walks you through a few real-life tasks so you can start automating and extending Pardot. In this guide: We implement authentication using an OAuth2.0 flow. Make some example calls and complete a basic task. Before you begin, make sure you have: A Salesforce admin to create a connected app and gather information. A Salesforce user with SSO enabled for Pardot. A configured Pardot Business Unit. Selected which OAuth flow works best for your case. This tutorial uses the Web Server OAuth flow. This tutorial requires background knowledge of connected apps and authentication. If you're unfamiliar with these topics, we strongly recommend that you check out these resources first: Salesforce Help: Connected App and OAuth Terminology Trailhead module: Connected App Basics Trailhead module: Build a Connected App for API Integration After you familiarize yourself with the basics, come back to this tutorial. Warning The calls you make during this tutorial have the potential to impact both your Salesforce and Pardot settings and data. If you\u2019re just testing the API, make sure that you\u2019re using a sandbox account. If you\u2019re using this tutorial to set up your production account, use caution. Authentication To authenticate to use Pardot APIs, you must use an SSO-enabled Salesforce user who has Pardot access, and an OAuth flow with a connected app. Implementing authentication can be tricky, so we walk through an example here. Step 1: Create the Connected App The first step in authentication is creating a connected app. A connected app is a framework that enables an external application to integrate with Salesforce using APIs and standard protocols like OAuth. Connected apps use these protocols to authenticate, authorize, and provide single sign-on (SSO) for external apps. To put it simply, a connected app represents an integration. To set up a connected app, have a Salesforce admin follow these steps: From Salesforce Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter App Manager , and then select App Manager . Click New Connected App . Name the connected app, and enter contact details for the app owner. In the API section, select the Enable OAuth Flows . Enter a Callback URL. The callback URL is used to redirect users after authentication in browser-based flows. In this example, we use https://my.example.com/myapp . If you\u2019re using a browser-based flow (such as Web Server Flow or User Agent Flow), the URL must match the URL you pass as a callback to OAuth endpoints. If you aren\u2019t using a browser-based flow, the URL entered isn't used. Under Selected OAuth Scopes , add Access Pardot services , which give the app access to Pardot. For more complex scenarios, such as using refresh tokens, select other scopes as well. Save the connected app. This just scratches the surface of connected apps. If you\u2019d like to learn more, like how to restrict access to certain users, check out these resources: Connected App Salesforce Help Connected App Trailhead Step 2: Gather Important Information Now that you have a connected app, let\u2019s gather some important information you need handy to finish setting up authentication. The primary details are: Connected App Consumer Key: a unique identifier for your connected app. Connected App Consumer Secret: a password for the connected app. Business Unit IDs: Because a Salesforce org can have multiple business units, the ID routes the API request to the correct business unit. You need the ID even if you have only one business unit. Salesforce User: A Salesforce user with SSO enabled for Pardot. Since all this information is sensitive, carefully consider how to securely share these details with other team members. Find the Consumer Key and Secret From Salesforce Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter App Manager , and then select App Manager . Go to your connected app and select View . Copy your consumer key. Reveal and copy your consumer secret. Find the Pardot Business Unit IDs From Marketing Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Pardot , and then select Pardot Account Setup . Copy the business unit ID for the Pardot instance you want to use. Choose the Integration User For the integration user, we recommend that you create a unique user for each specific app integration. The user must be SSO-enabled and have access to Pardot. Step 3: Implement OAuth Flow Salesforce has several OAuth flows to meet your unique security and integration needs. In this tutorial, we use the Web Server OAuth flow . This flow is ideal for when you don't want to store the end user's credentials in your system. To learn more about your options and how to choose the best OAuth flow for your integration, check out Salesforce OAuth Help Documentation . Have your integration direct the user to Salesforce\u2019s OAuth authorization endpoint: https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=https://my.example.com/myapp Replace CLIENT_ID with your connected app consumer key. Replace https://my.example.com/myapp with your redirect URI. If the user doesn't have an active session, they\u2019re prompted to log into Salesforce. The user grants the app permission. After the user has logged in and allowed the app, Salesforce redirects you back to the redirect_uri passed in to the authorize endpoint: https://my.example.com/myapp?code=<CODE> Your server-side code exchanges this code for an access token by making a POST request to the Salesforce OAuth token endpoint: POST /services/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1 Host: login.salesforce.com Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded grant_type=authorization_code& code=<CODE>& client_id=<CLIENT_ID>& client_secret=<CONSUMER_SECRET>& redirect_uri=https://my.example.com/myapp After Salesforce validates the connected app credentials and authorization code, the endpoint responds with an access token: { \"Access_token\": \"<ACCESS TOKEN>\", \"signature\": \"<SIGNATURE>\", \"instance_url\": \"https://example.salesforce.com\", \"id\": \"https://login.salesforce.com/id/00000000000/0000000000\", \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"issued_at\": \"1558553873237\" } The access token can be used to make calls to the Pardot API. The code was exchanged for the access token on the server side and not from the user\u2019s browser. Because of how the code was exchanged, there's no opportunity for malicious JavaScript to steal the access token. After you've implemented authorization, you can start working with Pardot APIs. Working with the API The Pardot API lets your application access current data within Pardot. Through the API, you can perform several common operations on Pardot objects including the following: create : Creates an instance of the object with the specified parameters. read : Retrieves information about the specified object. query : Retrieves objects that match specified criteria. update : Updates elements of an existing object. upsert : Updates elements of an existing object if it exists. If the object doesn\u2019t exist, one is created using the supplied parameters. Developers must authenticate using a Salesforce OAuth endpoint or the Pardot API login endpoint before issuing Pardot API requests. Refer to the Authentication section for details about this procedure. Keep in mind a few considerations when you perform requests. For update requests, only the fields specified in the request are updated. All others are left unchanged. If a required field is cleared during an update, the request is declined. Request Format All requests to the API must: Use either HTTP GET or POST. Version 5 also supports PUT and DELETE requests. Pass access token in an HTTP Authorization header. Pass Pardot Business Unit ID in an HTTP Pardot-Business-Unit-Id header. Use the correct URL for your Pardot environment. Our First GET Request In this example, we want to get a list of all custom fields in a business unit. Before you begin, make sure you've authenticated and have a valid access token. For simplicity in this example, these calls are written in HTTP. GET /api/customField/version/4/do/query?format=json HTTP/1.1 Host: pi.pardot.com Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN> Pardot-Business-Unit-Id: <BUSINESS UNIT ID> Breaking Down the Request Let's break down the call and identify its parts, starting with the uniform resource identifier (URI). GET 'https://<ENVIRONMENT_URL>/api/<OBJECT>/version/<API_VERSION>/do/<OPERATION>?format=<FORMAT> Environment URL : In the example, we use pi.pardot.com, but you use the URL that matches your environment type. Demos, developer orgs, and sandbox environments are hosted on the domain pi.demo.pardot.com. Training and production environments are hosted on the domain pi.pardot.com. Object : The object we're requesting data for. In our example, we're querying the CustomField object. API version : The version of the API you're using. Here, we use v4. Operation : The operation you're performing. Here, we use query . Format : The output format, either XML or JSON. Here, we use json . Now that we've explained the URI, let's examine the header lines in the call. 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>' lets Pardot know that you\u2019ve authenticated and have permission to access data. 'Pardot-Business-Unit-Id: <BUSINESS UNIT ID>' lets Pardot know which business unit you want data from. Host : The URL for your Pardot environment. Breaking Down the Response The call returns the business unit's custom fields and their metadata. { \"@attributes\" : { \"version\" : 1, \"stat\" : \"ok\" }, \"result\" : { \"customField\" : [ { \"id\" : 14141, \"is_use_values\" : false, \"crm_id\" : null, \"is_record_multiple_responses\" : false, \"field_id\" : \"Attended_Event\", \"type_id\" : 1, \"updated_at\" : \"2020-08-04 05:45:36\", \"is_analytics_synced\" : false, \"type\" : \"Text\", \"created_at\" : \"2020-08-04 05:45:36\", \"name\" : \"Attended Event?\" }, { \"id\" : 14143, \"is_use_values\" : false, \"crm_id\" : null, \"is_record_multiple_responses\" : false, \"field_id\" : \"Birthday\", \"type_id\" : 12, \"is_analytics_synced\" : false, \"updated_at\" : \"2020-08-04 05:45:56\", \"created_at\" : \"2020-08-04 05:45:56\", \"name\" : \"Birthday\", \"type\" : \"Date\" }, ], \"total_results\" : 2 } } Learn more about each object's fields in the Object Field Reference documentation . Our First POST Request Warning: If you\u2019re following along with your Pardot account, this next example creates a list in your account. Either use a sandbox account, or tailor the example to fit your needs. In this example, we create a list for a spring nurturing campaign. Before you begin, make sure you've authenticated and have a valid access token. POST /api/list/version/4/do/create?format=json HTTP/1.1 Host: pi.pardot.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN> Pardot-Business-Unit-Id: <BUSINESS UNIT ID> name=Spring Leads Nurture&title=Spring Leads title&description=A list to nurture spring leads Breaking Down the Request We went over the URI and the authorization and business unit headers in the GET example. Let's cover the other components: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded : Lets the server know what kind of data the request includes. name=Spring Leads Nurture : Sets the list's internal name to \"Spring Leads Nurture\". title=Spring Leads : Titles the list \"Spring Leads\". description=A list to nurture spring leads : Adds a text description to the list. Breaking Down the Response When we send this request to the server, Pardot responds by creating a list with the criteria that we specified. The response looks like this: { \"@attributes\": { \"stat\": \"ok\", \"version\": 1 }, \"list\": { \"id\": 1000, \"name\": \"Spring Leads Nurture\", \"is_public\": false, \"is_dynamic\": false, \"title\": \"Spring Leads\", \"description\": \"A list to nurture spring leads \", \"is_crm_visible\": false, \"created_at\": \"2021-02-12 08:09:10\", \"updated_at\": \"2021-02-12 08:09:10\" } } Going Further Let's take the example a step further and add a prospect to our new list. Remember that completing this task changes data in Pardot, so proceed with caution. Before you begin, make sure you've authorized and have a valid access token. For simplicity in this example, we make these calls in our command-line interface using cURL. First, copy the list ID for the list you want to add a prospect to. Then, find the IDs for the prospect you want to add to the list. You can use query on the Prospect object to get ID. List ID: 1000 Prospect ID: XXXXX POST /api/prospect/version/4/do/update/id/XXXXX?format=json HTTP/1.1 Host: pi.pardot.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN> Pardot-Business-Unit-Id: <BUSINESS UNIT ID> list_<ID>=1000 Notice that the URI includes the prospect's ID: XXXXX. When we send this request, Pardot adds that prospect to the list with the ID 1000. What's Next That's a wrap! Now that you've made some basic calls, we hope you feel confident about using Pardot APIs to extend and automate your business!

The API has so many possibilities that it can feel overwhelming to get started, so we\u2019ve rounded up a few common use cases here. Start with these examples, then get creative. Data Augmentation You can use the Pardot API to clean and enrich prospect data, saving your sales reps hours of time spent on menial tasks. Automate data clean up tasks like normalizing picklist values, capitalizing names, and formatting phone numbers. You can also add data from your vendors by updating prospects via the API. Example Your manager asks you to fix all prospect name fields that are in all-caps or lowercase. They also want you to update prospect scores regularly, based on an internal scoring tool. You write some code that checks each prospect name and updates the capitalization. You set it up to run when a new prospect is added, keeping the database neat. You then set up an integration between your internal scoring tool and Pardot that updates the prospect score field every day. Pardot Objects: Prospect: get prospect data, update prospect field values Advanced Reporting Use the Pardot API to automate exporting visitor data to your own external analytics tools for richer insights. Example The marketing team wants a detailed analysis of all the web analytics to see how much budget they need to drive clicks and sync web ad targeting. You automate a bulk export of Pardot visitor data, then import it into your company\u2019s analytics tool at regular intervals. Pardot Objects: Visitor Activity (via the Export API) Prospect: get prospect data Prospect Account: get prospect account data Enhanced Segmentation Use the Pardot API to help you target the right groups of prospects, so you can optimize your messaging and personalization. If another system contains most of your data, you can segment prospects in that system instead of Pardot. In this case, use the API to get the prospect data you need. Do your segmentation analysis outside of Pardot so you can update the prospects. Then, import the updated prospects into Pardot and add them to lists for engagement programs and other marketing efforts Example A marketing manager at your company wants to create a Pardot list for a new marketing initiative, but the information for the segmentation criteria is hosted outside of Pardot. The manager gives you a list from an external database, and the list includes Pardot prospect IDs. You use the Create operation with the List object and create a Pardot list.

It uses Pardot's existing API structures, patterns, and terminology. When to Use the Export API Use the Export API to retrieve large sets of data when you don't need synchronous completion responses or when query limitations are too restrictive. Currently, only visitor activity is supported. How the Export API Works An export is associated with a query and a data set in Pardot. When you create an export, the query is split into smaller queries, which return smaller sets of data. These smaller queries are processed in parallel, and the retrieved data is saved in CSV files. When the export is complete, the CSV files are available to download. The order of the records returned in the CSV files isn\u2019t guaranteed. The number of records in each CSV file varies, and all of the files associated with an export make up the full data set for the query. The Export resource is used to create an export and get the status of an export. When the export is complete, the links to the CSV files containing the data are available in the resource. Limitations The Export API is subject to the daily Pardot API call limit and the concurrent Pardot API call limit for your account. Export API calls are executed sequentially for each account, with older exports being processed before newer exports. Expiration The data associated with an export expires after 7 days. When data expires, the Export resource removes links to the CSV files and shows that the export has expired. Attempts to retrieve the data after an export expires fail. CSV File Formatting The first row contains the name of the field. The second row and beyond contain the record data. Dates are returned in the user\u2019s timezone at the time they created the export. For example, if a user is in \u201cPST\u201d timezone and creates an export, the dates in the export are in \u201cPST\u201d. If a second user is in \u201cEST\u201d timezone and downloads the exported files, the dates in the export are in \u201cPST\u201d. If a user\u2019s timezone changes, previous exports created by the user have dates formatted in the previous timezone. Dates in new exports use the new timezone. Dates are returned in the standard Pardot API date format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS . Fields with null values are represented as an empty value in CSV. String field values are wrapped in double quotes. Field values containing commas, \\n, \\r are wrapped with double quotes. Field values containing double quotes have those double quotes escaped with an additional double quote \"\"\" and are wrapped in double quotes. Example value: The output of The \"Widget Co\" CEO is \"The \"\"Widget Co\"\" CEO\" . Field values containing only whitespace are wrapped in double quotes. Field values starting with the values: =, +, @ have these characters escaped with a backslash. Example value: The output of @mysocialmediahandle is \"\\@mysocialmediahandle\" Procedures A procedure is a query and execution plan used to retrieve the data. Each object has a different set of procedures. Visitor Activity Fields Select the visitor activity fields you want to export. Following are the fields that are available for visitor activity. The value for fields must be an array of strings of the available fields. Abilities Action Requirements Create export Prospects > Visitors > View ability View export Prospects > Visitors > View ability and be the same user that created the export View all exports Admin > Exports > View ability Query exports Admin > Exports > View ability To create an export with this procedure, the user must have the following: \u201cProspects > Visitors > View\u201c ability To view an export with this procedure, the user must have the following: \u201cProspects > Visitors > View\u201c ability AND The user must be the same as the user that created the export OR \u201cAdmin > Exports > View\u201d filter_by_created_at Retrieves all visitor activity records with a created_at value that is greater than the created_after argument and less than the created_before argument. Arguments created_after : Selects visitor activities that were created after the specified time. The value can be today , yesterday , last_7_days , this_month , last_month , or a custom time specified in GNU Date Input Syntax format. created_before : (Optional) Selects visitor activities that were created before the specified time. This value must be after the value in created_after . If this argument isn\u2019t specified, then no upper boundary is used in the query, and all data after the created_after is returned. The value can be today , yesterday , last_7_days , this_month , last_month , or a custom time specified in GNU Date Input Syntax format. type : (Optional) Selects visitor activities of the specified types. If this argument isn\u2019t specified, then all of the visitor activities belonging to any type is returned. See a list of available Visitor Activity Types in Visitor Activity in Object Field References . prospect_only : (Optional) Selects only those visitor activities associated with a prospect. When this field is set to false , all visitor activities with and without a prospect are returned. The values can be true or false . filter_by_updated_at Retrieves all visitor activity records with an updated_at value that is greater than the updated_after argument and less than the updated_before argument. Arguments updated_after : Selects visitor activities that were updated after the specified time. The value can be today , yesterday , last_7_days , this_month , last_month , or a custom time specified in GNU Date Input Syntax format. updated_before : (Optional) Selects visitor activities that were updated before the specified time. This value must be after the value in updated_after . If this argument isn\u2019t specified, then no upper boundary is used in the query, and all data after the updated_after is returned. The value can be today , yesterday , last_7_days , this_month , last_month , or a custom time specified in GNU Date Input Syntax format. type : (Optional) Selects visitor activities of the specified types. If this argument isn\u2019t specified, then all visitor activities belonging to any type are returned. See a list of available Visitor Activity Types in Visitor Activity in Object Field References . prospect_only : (Optional) Selects only those visitor activities associated with a prospect.

It uses Pardot's existing API structures, patterns, and terminology. The Import API automates the existing prospect import feature set . Only prospect import is supported currently. IMPORTANT The user's role must have the Prospect Import ability to start an API import. For more information, see Pardot User Roles When to Use the Import API Use the Import API to insert or update large sets of data, when you don't require synchronous completion responses, or when batch upsert limitations are too restrictive. Currently, only Prospect upsert is supported. The Import API processes many records asynchronously in batches. Each batch requires a minimum amount of system resources to run, so larger batches are more efficient. Small batches may result in slower performance. What You Can Do with the Import API The Import API lets you import a CSV file of prospects. Columns in the CSV correspond to Pardot field names . Rows correspond to prospects to be upserted. Each column must match a valid field name, or validation fails and the CSV is rejected. Matching and Upsert Behavior When a row in the CSV file matches an existing prospect, the prospect is updated. Field values in the CSV, including blank (null) values, overwrite existing values for the prospect. To modify this default behavior, see the columns param on the Create endpoint. A new prospect is created when a matching prospect isn't found. All standard and custom fields are supported. In API Version 3, prospects are matched by email address. If the matched prospect is in the recycle bin, that record won't upsert unless the restoreDeleted option is specified during import creation. The rest of the import isn't affected when a record is skipped. How the Import API Works An import contains a set of records divided into one or more batches of data. A batch is a set of records sent to the server in an HTTP POST request. The import specifies which object is processed and what type of operation is used. The Import API currently supports only the Prospect object and the Upsert operation. Batches are processed in parallel, and batches are subdivided into smaller groups of objects for processing. The order in which individual records, batches, and entire imports are processed isn\u2019t guaranteed. The Import resource is used to create an import, get status for an import, upload data as a batch, and change status for an import. When a batch finishes processing, the result for failed records is available in a result set resource. All other records are assumed to be successful. Users create, submit, and retrieve results of imports with the following steps. Create an import that specifies object and action. Upload data to the server in one or more batches. To submit the import for processing, set the state of the import to \"Ready\". After the import is submitted, you can't add more batches of data or abort the import. Check the status of the import at a reasonable interval. We recommend that you wait a few minutes between calls. Calls to check import status count against API call limits. When the results of the status check indicate a complete import, the results also contain statistics for creates, updates, and failures. If there are failures, download a log of failures. The log includes only records not inserted or updated. Imports left in the \"Open\" state expire after 24 hours. Limitations Each account can process 1000 batches per day. Each batch must be smaller than 10 MB. The daily data limit is 10 GB. Each import can contain up to 10 batches. The daily Pardot API call limit and the concurrent Pardot API call limit apply to Import API calls just as they would any other Pardot API calls. Expiration Imports expire: 24 hours after creation if the import isn't submitted. No records are imported in this case, even if batches of data have been added. 7 days after completion. After an import expires, it can't be changed and attempts to check its status or retrieve error results will fail. Getting Started This document assumes that you're familiar with connecting to the Pardot API, managing prospects, and creating CSV files. You can import data by using these endpoints. Create /api/import/version/3/do/create Used to create a new asynchronous import. If a batch of import data is included in this request, the import can be submitted for processing as part of this operation. Otherwise one or more batches must be created and associated with this import using the do/batch endpoint and the import must be submitted for processing with the do/update endpoint. POST Params Request Body ContentType: application/json or multipart/form-data Use multipart/form-data if sending prospect data in the create request. Use application/json if subsequent do/batch requests are made with prospect data. Input Representation (sent as \" importInput \" if ContentType is multipart/form-data): operation : The operation to be executed. Currently only \u201cUpsert\u201d is available. See Import Operation enum for more information. object : The current object to be run the import against. Currently only \u201cProspect\u201d is available. See Import Object enum for more information. restoreDeleted : (Optional) If a record within the CSV file matches a record that was moved to the Recycle Bin, usually through a Delete, the record can be restored and updated. If the property is true, then the record is restored and updated. If false, the record is ignored and an error occurs The error appears in the error document after the import is completed. Default if not specified is false. state : (Optional) Specify \"Ready\" to indicate that the CSV file included in the request contains all prospects for this import. In this case, do/batch and do/update requests aren't required and should be omitted. columns : (Optional) If specified, the columns must include the same number of fields as the CSV file does. If they don't match then a 400 BAD_REQUEST failure occurs. The elements for this are: field : (Required) The field name must match one of the columns in the CSV file overwrite : (Optional, default true) When set to true and updating an existing record, the value in the input modifies (\"overwrite\") the existing value in the database. When set to false, the existing value in the database won\u2019t update regardless of the value of the input. If the input row is a \"Create\", then this option is ignored and the value is present in the database. nullOverwrite : (Optional, default true) When set to true and updating an existing record, if the value in the input is an empty string or a string containing any number of whitespaces then the value in the database is set to empty string or null. When set to false the empty input value is ignored and the existing value in the database isn't updated. If the input row is a \"Create\" then this option is ignored and the empty string or null is present in the database. { \"operation\": \"Upsert\", \"object\": \"Prospect\", \"restoreDeleted\": boolean, \"state\": \"Ready\", \"columns\": [ {\"field\": \"field1_name\", \"overwrite\": boolean, \"nullOverwrite\": boolean }, {\"field\": \"field2_name\"}, ... ] } A single part with the name \" importFile \" contains the CSV file for the batch.

Assigning and Reassigning Prospects To assign/reassign a prospect, both the prospect to be assigned and the target user or group of the assignment must be defined. Prospects can be specified by their Pardot ID or email address. Users or groups can be specified by their Pardot user ID, email address, or Pardot group ID. Possible combinations of parameters are shown below. Developers are responsible for substituting specific values for parameters denoted by <carets> . Examples: /api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/email/?user_email= /api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/email/?user_id= /api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/email/?group_id= /api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?user_email= /api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?user_id= /api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?group_id= XML responses to assign requests are identical to read requests, but reflect the new prospect assignment in the <assigned_to> node. Creating Prospects To create a prospect via the API, only a valid and unique email address is required. Values for any other prospect fields may also be provided in the create request. Developers are responsible for substituting specific values for parameters denoted by <carets> . Example: Creating a new prospect /api/prospect/version/3/do/create/email/ new_prospect@pardot.com ?first_name=New&last_name=Prospect XML responses to create requests are identical to update and read requests. If no campaign_id value is provided, the new prospect will be automatically assigned to the oldest existing campaign. Endpoints for Batch Processing There are 3 endpoints available for batch processing up to 50 prospects at a time: /api/prospect/version/3/do/batchCreate /api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpdate /api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpsert These endpoints expect a query variable called \"prospects\" which holds either JSON or XML encoded data. Each prospect should have a unique identifier which will be used in the return output. JSON Example: { \"prospects\": { \"1234\": { \"first_name\": \"New first name\", \"last_name\": \"New last name\" }, \"some@email.com\": { \"first_name\": \"New first name\", \"last_name\": \"New last name\" }, \"some.other@email.com\": { \"first_name\": \"New first name\", \"last_name\": \"New last name\" } } } XML Example: <prospects> <prospect identifier=\"1234\"> <first_name>New first name</first_name> <last_name>New last name</last_name> </prospect> <prospect identifier=\"some@email.com\"> <first_name>New first name</first_name> <last_name>New last name</last_name> </prospect> <prospect identifier=\"some.other@email.com\"> <first_name>New first name</first_name> <last_name>New last name</last_name> </prospect> </prospects> If using batchCreate , you'll need to provide a valid and unique email address for each prospect. The batchUpdate and batchUpsert endpoints allow the use of a prospect ID or prospect email address. Example: /api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpdate?prospects={\"prospects\":{\"some@email.com\":{\"first_name\":\"New first name\",\"last_name\":\"New last name\"},\"1234\":{\"first_name\":\"New first name\",\"last_name\":\"New last name\"}}} Note: The return value will either be XML or JSON (XML by default. If you want JSON, then add \"&format=json\" to your HTTP query). Updating Field Values Modifying values of prospect data fields is done by submitting an update request with parameters for each field to be updated. Each parameter is formatted as <field_name>=<value> . Custom field values are updated using the same syntax. Example: Updating the phone number of a prospect whose email address is bob@pardot.com : /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/ bob@pardot.com ?phone=888-123-4567 Only values that are specifically named in the request are updated. All others are left unchanged. To clear a value, submit an update request containing a parameter with no specified value, such as phone= . Note: Any field that is set to record multiple responses cannot have its values cleared this way. Updating Fields with Predefined Values Modifying values of prospect data fields with predefined values is accomplished through an update request with parameters for each field to be updated. Each parameter is formatted as <field_name>=<value> where <value> matches the predefined field value. Custom field values are updated using the same syntax. Example: Updating the category of a prospect whose email address is bob@pardot.com *to the category consumer : /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/ bob@pardot.com ?category=consumer Updating Fields with Multiple Values Updating field values with multiple values follows the same convention as fields with predefined values, but requires a different parameter naming scheme to allow multiplicity. An update request is submitted with parameters formatted as <field_name>_<count>=<field_value> where <count> is an integer denoting the current parameter's place in sequence. <count> must start at 0 and increase by 1 until all desired values are submitted. Example: Modifying the values of a custom field with field name past_jobs for a prospect with a Pardot ID of 5 : /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/5?past_jobs_0=janitor&past_jobs_1=security Note: Checkbox and multi-select fields are the only field types that can be updated in this manner. To clear all of the values for a checkbox or multi-select field, use <field_name>_0= . To clear specific values, just set the values that should remain in the prospect record using the method above. Updating Email List Subscriptions To modify email list subscriptions for a prospect, the Pardot ID of the email list is required. Once the ID is obtained, an update is submitted with parameters formatted as list_<list_id>=1 to create a subscription and list_<list_id>=0 to end a subscription. Example: Adding a prospect whose email address is bob@pardot.com to an email list with Pardot ID 8 : /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/ bob@pardot.com ?list_8=1 Requests that attempt to subscribe a prospect to lists that it is already subscribed to are ignored. Unsubscribe requests are handled similarly. Updating Profile Criteria Matching Statuses To modify a prospect's matching status for associated profile criteria, the Pardot ID of the profile criteria is required. Once the ID is obtained, an update is submitted with parameters formatted as profile_criteria_<profile_criteria_id>=<status> . The value of <status> may be either match , nomatch , or unknown . Example: Setting a profile criteria for a prospect whose email address is bob@pardot.com to match : /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/ bob@pardot.com ?profile_criteria_8=match Example: Setting a profile criteria for a prospect with Pardot ID 58 to nomatch : /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/58?profile_criteria_8=nomatch Only profile criteria that belong to the profile associated with the prospect can be updated using this method. Requests to update profile criteria not associated with the assigned profile will be ignored. Using any matching status values other than match , nomatch , or unknown will result in an error message. See Error Codes & Messages for details. Updating Prospect Account Associations To modify a prospect's matching status for associated prospect account, the Pardot ID of the prospect account is required. Once the ID is obtained, an update is submitted with parameters formatted as prospect_account_id=<id> . Example: Setting a prospect account for a prospect whose email address is bob@pardot.com to match : /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/ bob@pardot.com ?prospect_account_id= A prospect account with the id must exist, and can not be set if a CRM connector is set up in the account.","title":"Prospects"},{"location":"kb/api-version-3/prospects/#querying-prospects","text":"","title":"Querying Prospects"},{"location":"kb/api-version-3/prospects/#supported-operations","text":"Operation URL Format Required Parameters Description query /api/prospect/version/3/do/query?... - Returns the prospects matching the specified criteria parameters.

It uses Pardot's existing API structures, patterns, and terminology. When to Use the Export API Use the Export API to retrieve large sets of data when you don't need synchronous completion responses or when query limitations are too restrictive. Currently, only visitor activity is supported. How the Export API Works An export is associated with a query and a data set in Pardot. When you create an export, the query is split into smaller queries, which return smaller sets of data. These smaller queries are processed in parallel, and the retrieved data is saved in CSV files. When the export is complete, the CSV files are available to download. The order of the records returned in the CSV files isn\u2019t guaranteed. The number of records in each CSV file varies, and all of the files associated with an export make up the full data set for the query. The Export resource is used to create an export and get the status of an export. When the export is complete, the links to the CSV files containing the data are available in the resource. Limitations The Export API is subject to the daily Pardot API call limit and the concurrent Pardot API call limit for your account. Export API calls are executed sequentially for each account, with older exports being processed before newer exports. Expiration The data associated with an export expires after 7 days. When data expires, the Export resource removes links to the CSV files and shows that the export has expired. Attempts to retrieve the data after an export expires fail. CSV File Formatting The first row contains the name of the field. The second row and beyond contain the record data. Dates are returned in the user\u2019s timezone at the time they created the export. For example, if a user is in \u201cPST\u201d timezone and creates an export, the dates in the export are in \u201cPST\u201d. If a second user is in \u201cEST\u201d timezone and downloads the exported files, the dates in the export are in \u201cPST\u201d. If a user\u2019s timezone changes, previous exports created by the user have dates formatted in the previous timezone. Dates in new exports use the new timezone. Dates are returned in the standard Pardot API date format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS . Fields with null values are represented as an empty value in CSV. String field values are wrapped in double quotes. Field values containing commas, \\n, \\r are wrapped with double quotes. Field values containing double quotes have those double quotes escaped with an additional double quote \"\"\" and are wrapped in double quotes. Example value: The output of The \"Widget Co\" CEO is \"The \"\"Widget Co\"\" CEO\" . Field values containing only whitespace are wrapped in double quotes. Field values starting with the values: =, +, @ have these characters escaped with a backslash. Example value: The output of @mysocialmediahandle is \"\\@mysocialmediahandle\" Procedures A procedure is a query and execution plan used to retrieve the data. Each object has a different set of procedures. Visitor Activity Fields Select the visitor activity fields you want to export. Following are the fields that are available for visitor activity. The value for fields must be an array of strings of the available fields. Abilities Action Requirements Create export Prospects > Visitors > View ability View export Prospects > Visitors > View ability and be the same user that created the export View all exports Admin > Exports > View ability Query exports Admin > Exports > View ability To create an export with this procedure, the user must have the following: \u201cProspects > Visitors > View\u201c ability To view an export with this procedure, the user must have the following: \u201cProspects > Visitors > View\u201c ability AND The user must be the same as the user that created the export OR \u201cAdmin > Exports > View\u201d filter_by_created_at Retrieves all visitor activity records with a created_at value that is greater than the created_after argument and less than the created_before argument. Arguments created_after : Selects visitor activities that were created after the specified time. The value can be today , yesterday , last_7_days , this_month , last_month , or a custom time specified in GNU Date Input Syntax format. created_before : (Optional) Selects visitor activities that were created before the specified time. This value must be after the value in created_after . If this argument isn\u2019t specified, then no upper boundary is used in the query, and all data after the created_after is returned. The value can be today , yesterday , last_7_days , this_month , last_month , or a custom time specified in GNU Date Input Syntax format. type : (Optional) Selects visitor activities of the specified types. If this argument isn\u2019t specified, then all of the visitor activities belonging to any type is returned. See a list of available Visitor Activity Types in Visitor Activity in Object Field References . prospect_only : (Optional) Selects only those visitor activities associated with a prospect. When this field is set to false , all visitor activities with and without a prospect are returned. The values can be true or false . filter_by_updated_at Retrieves all visitor activity records with an updated_at value that is greater than the updated_after argument and less than the updated_before argument. Arguments updated_after : Selects visitor activities that were updated after the specified time. The value can be today , yesterday , last_7_days , this_month , last_month , or a custom time specified in GNU Date Input Syntax format. updated_before : (Optional) Selects visitor activities that were updated before the specified time.

It uses Pardot's existing API structures, patterns, and terminology. The Import API automates the existing prospect import feature set . Only prospect import is supported currently. IMPORTANT The user's role must have the Prospect Import ability to start an API import. For more information, see Pardot User Roles When to Use the Import API Use the Import API to insert or update large sets of data, when you don't require synchronous completion responses, or when batch upsert limitations are too restrictive. Currently, only Prospect upsert is supported. The Import API processes many records asynchronously in batches. Each batch requires a minimum amount of system resources to run, so larger batches are more efficient. Small batches may result in slower performance. What You Can Do with the Import API The Import API lets you import a CSV file of prospects. Columns in the CSV correspond to Pardot field names . Rows correspond to prospects to be upserted. Each column must match a valid field name, or validation fails and the CSV is rejected. Matching and Upsert Behavior When a row in the CSV file matches an existing prospect, the prospect is updated. Field values in the CSV, including blank (null) values, overwrite existing values for the prospect. To modify this default behavior, see the columns param on the Create endpoint. A new prospect is created when a matching prospect isn't found. All standard and custom fields are supported. In API Version 4, you must specify either the \"prospect_id\" or \"salesforce_fid\" identifier (Salesforce ID of a synced prospect). If you don't specify an identifier, or the prospect that is matched is in the recycle bin, that record isn't upserted unless the restoreDeleted option is specified during import creation. The rest of the import isn't affected when a record is skipped. How the Import API Works An import contains a set of records divided into one or more batches of data. A batch is a set of records sent to the server in an HTTP POST request. The import specifies which object is processed and what type of operation is used. The Import API currently supports only the Prospect object and the Upsert operation. Batches are processed in parallel, and batches are subdivided into smaller groups of objects for processing. The order in which individual records, batches, and entire imports are processed isn\u2019t guaranteed. The Import resource is used to create an import, get status for an import, upload data as a batch, and change status for an import. When a batch finishes processing, the result for failed records is available in a result set resource. All other records are assumed to be successful. Users create, submit, and retrieve results of imports with the following steps. Create an import that specifies object and action. Upload data to the server in one or more batches. To submit the import for processing, set the state of the import to \"Ready\". After the import is submitted, you can't add more batches of data or abort the import. Check the status of the import at a reasonable interval. We recommend that you wait a few minutes between calls. Calls to check import status count against API call limits. When the results of the status check indicate a complete import, the results also contain statistics for creates, updates, and failures. If there are failures, download a log of failures. The log includes only records not inserted or updated. Imports left in the \"Open\" state expire after 24 hours. Limitations Each account can process 1000 batches per day. Each batch must be smaller than 10 MB. The daily data limit is 10 GB. Each import can contain up to 10 batches. The daily Pardot API call limit and the concurrent Pardot API call limit apply to Import API calls just as they would any other Pardot API calls. Expiration Imports expire: 24 hours after creation if the import isn't submitted. No records are imported in this case, even if batches of data have been added. 7 days after completion. After an import expires, it can't be changed and attempts to check its status or retrieve error results will fail. Getting Started This document assumes that you're familiar with connecting to the Pardot API, managing prospects, and creating CSV files. You can import data by using these endpoints. Create /api/import/version/4/do/create Used to create a new asynchronous import. If a batch of import data is included in this request, the import can be submitted for processing as part of this operation. Otherwise one or more batches must be created and associated with this import using the do/batch endpoint and the import must be submitted for processing with the do/update endpoint. POST Params Request Body ContentType: application/json or multipart/form-data Use multipart/form-data if sending prospect data in the create request. Use application/json if subsequent do/batch requests are made with prospect data. Input Representation (sent as \" importInput \" if ContentType is multipart/form-data): operation : The operation to be executed. Currently only \u201cUpsert\u201d is available. See Import Operation enum for more information. object : The current object to be run the import against. Currently only \u201cProspect\u201d is available. See Import Object enum for more information. restoreDeleted : (Optional) If a record within the CSV file matches a record that was moved to the Recycle Bin, usually through a Delete, the record can be restored and updated. If the property is true, then the record is restored and updated. If false, the record is ignored and an error occurs The error appears in the error document after the import is completed. Default if not specified is false. state : (Optional) Specify \"Ready\" to indicate that the CSV file included in the request contains all prospects for this import. In this case, do/batch and do/update requests aren't required and should be omitted. columns : (Optional) If specified, the columns must include the same number of fields as the CSV file does. If they don't match then a 400 BAD_REQUEST failure occurs. The elements for this are: field : (Required) The field name must match one of the columns in the CSV file overwrite : (Optional, default true) When set to true and updating an existing record, the value in the input modifies (\"overwrite\") the existing value in the database. When set to false, the existing value in the database won\u2019t update regardless of the value of the input. If the input row is a \"Create\", then this option is ignored and the value is present in the database. nullOverwrite : (Optional, default true) When set to true and updating an existing record, if the value in the input is an empty string or a string containing whitespaces then the value in the database is set to empty string or null. When set to false the empty input value is ignored and the existing value in the database isn't updated. If the input row is a \"Create\" then this option is ignored and the empty string or null is present in the database. { \"operation\": \"Upsert\", \"object\": \"Prospect\", \"restoreDeleted\": boolean, \"state\": \"Ready\", \"columns\": [ {\"field\": \"field1_name\", \"overwrite\": boolean, \"nullOverwrite\": boolean }, {\"field\": \"field2_name\"}, ... ] } A single part with the name \" importFile \" contains the CSV file for the batch.

For information about other objects that aren't available in version 5, see the documentation for versions 3 or 4 . Data returned by version 5 endpoints is not real-time, so creates and updates may be delayed when reading and querying data. Authentication Developers must authenticate using a Salesforce OAuth endpoint or the Pardot API login endpoint before issuing Pardot API requests. For more information, see Authentication . Examples below are shown using Salesforce OAuth Access Tokens, but Pardot API Keys may be used as well. Formatting Object API Requests Use one of the following HTTP verbs for your version 5 API requests: GET - on collection endpoint to query for objects. GET - read an object. POST - create an object. PATCH - update an object. DELETE - delete an object. Query (using GET) Query requests are formatted as follows: GET /api/v5/objects/<object-collection>?<params> HTTP/1.1 Host: pi.pardot.com Authorization: Bearer <access-token> Parameters Below are the parameters shared across all objects. The object reference defines the parameters specific to the object. Parameter Required Description fields X A comma delimited list of fields to return. Use dot-delimited notation ( <field-name>.<sub-object-field-name> ) to specify fields on sub-objects. deleted (Defaults to false). Specify \"all\" to return records regardless of whether they are in the recycle bin or not. Specify true to return only deleted objects in the recycle bin. Specify false to return objects not found in the recycle bin. (Only supported for objects which are moved to the recycle bin in Pardot when deleted.) limit (Defaults to 200). The number of items to return. This must be a positive integer up to 1000. offset (Defaults to 0). The index of the first record to return. This must be a positive integer up 2000. If an offset more than 2000 is required, use the Export API instead. orderBy (Defaults to \"id asc\"). A comma delimited list of fields used to sort the results. An optional direction qualifier can be used to control the order direction of the order: \"ASC\" for ascending and \"DESC\" for descending order. An example orderBy clause may be \"createdAt asc, id desc\". Response Responses include, but are not limited to: Status Error Code Notes 200 OK The response body will contain an array of objects with the specified fields for the object as documented in Query Response Format . Query Response Format Version 5 responses are formatted as JSON unless otherwise noted. { \"values\": [ { \"<field-name>\": value, ... \"<field-name>\": { \"<field-name>\": value, ... }, ... ] } Read (using GET) Read requests are formatted as follows: GET /api/v5/objects/<object-collection>/<id>?<params> HTTP/1.1 Host: pi.pardot.com Authorization: Bearer <access-token> Parameters Parameter Required Description fields X A comma delimited list of fields to return. Use dot-delimited notation ( <field-name>.<sub-object-field-name> ) to specify fields on sub-objects. deleted (Defaults to false). Specify true to return an object regardless of whether it is in the recycle bin or not. Specify false to indicate that an error should be returned for deleted objects in the recycle bin (not distinguishing them from permanently deleted objects). (Only supported for objects which are moved to the recycle bin in Pardot when deleted.) Optional Header A request may include an If-Modified-Since header with an RFC7231 formatted date and time to check against the last updated time of the requested object. Response Responses include, but are not limited to: Status Error Code Notes 200 OK The response body will contain fields for the object as documented in Response Format . A Last-Modified header will be included on the response (see Response Headers ). 304 Not Modified The object has not been updated since the time specified in an included If-Modified-Since request header. The response body will be empty. Create (using POST) Create requests are formatted as follows: POST /api/v5/objects/<object-collection>?<params> HTTP/1.1 Host: pi.pardot.com Authorization: Bearer <access-token> Content-Type: <content-type> <input-representation> or <multi-part-request-body> Unless sending a file as part of the request (see below), the content type must be application-json . Parameters Parameter Required Description fields (Defaults to \"id\".) A comma delimited list of fields to return for the newly created object. Use dot-delimited notation ( <field-name>.<sub-object-field-name> ) to specify fields on sub-objects. Multipart Request Bodies Some objects (such as File) require a file to be uploaded along with the input representation when creating the object. In these cases the header Content-Type: multipart/form-data must be specified and the post data must have the following named parts: input - The input representation for the object (specifying fields and their values). file - The file data that corresponds with the object. Input representation When creating an object a JSON formatted input representation must be included to specify fields for the object. { \"<field-name>\": <value>, ... } Response Responses include, but are not limited to: Status Error Code Notes 201 Created The object was successfully created. The response body will contain fields for the object as documented in Response Format . The response will also contain a Location header with the URL to read the object (including the same fields requested in the fields parameter. Update (using PATCH) Update requests are formatted as follows: PATCH /api/v5/objects/<object-collection>/<id>?<params> HTTP/1.1 Host: pi.pardot.com Authorization: Bearer <access-token> Content-Type: <content-type> <input-representation> or <multi-part-request-body> Unless sending a file as part of the request (see below), the content type must be application-json . Parameters Parameter Required Description fields (Defaults to no fields.) A comma delimited list of fields to return for the updated object. Use dot-delimited notation ( <field-name>.<sub-object-field-name> ) to specify fields on sub-objects. Multipart Request Bodies Some objects (such as File) allow a file to be uploaded along with the input representation when creating the object. When uploading a file these cases the header Content-Type: multipart/form-data must be specified and the post data must have one or more of the following named parts: input - The input representation for the object (specifying fields and their values). file - The file data that corresponds with the object. If the update only includes fields and not a file, a multipart request body is not needed. This is true even for objects that require a file (and thus a multipart request body) at creation time. Input representation When updating an object a JSON formatted input representation must be included to specify fields for the object. { \"<field-name>\": <value>, ... } Fields that are omitted will be left unchanged. Response Responses include, but are not limited to: Status Error Code Notes 200 OK The object was successfully updated. The response body will contain fields for the object as documented in Response Format . 204 No Content The object was successfully updated. Because no output fields were requested, the response body will be empty. Delete (using DELETE): For some object types, delete requests result in permanent deletion. For other object types, delete requests move the object to the Pardot recycle bin. Delete requests do not cause related objects to be deleted. Delete requests are formatted as follows: DELETE /api/v5/objects/<object-collection>/<id> HTTP/1.1 Host: pi.pardot.com Authorization: Bearer <access-token> Response Responses include, but are not limited to: Status Error Code Notes 204 No Content Object was successfully deleted. The response body is empty. 405 Method Not Allowed 108 Object could not be deleted because it is used in other places. Response Format Version 5 responses are formatted as JSON unless otherwise noted. { \"<field-name>\": value, ... \"<field-name>\": { \"<field-name>\": value, ... } } As shown above, fields that are references to other objects have a JSON object with fields of the referenced object as their values. These are requested using dot delimited notation in the fields URL parameter. Response headers: Header Description Last-Modified Date that the object was last modified. (Sent only for GET requests.) Pardot-Warning Included in certain circumstances. Example: Pardot-Warning:201;Record In Recycle Bin when an API call fails because an object has been deleted and is in the recycle bin. Pardot-Warning header values Value Description 201;Record In Recycle Bin The API call failed because an object has been deleted and is in the recycle bin. 202;Record(s) have been redacted from output due to access rules Some values have been omitted from the API response because the user making the call does not have sufficient access rights to see the omitted data. Data Types Fields may be of the following data types: Type Notes String String of characters. Integer Number that must not contain a decimal point. Boolean The value true or false . DateTime ISO 8601 formatted date and time (including timezone offset). Object Some fields are references to another object. In these cases, responses can contain fields of the referenced object. Note that these are generally read only fields. Data will be a JSON object containing fields that were specified in the fields parameter using dot delimited notation. Error Responses Error responses from version 5 of the Pardot API have 4xx or 5xx HTTP status codes. Response statuses include, but are not limited to: Status Notes 400 Bad Request Possible reasons include missing required parameters. 404 Not Found Object with the given ID does not exist or is in the recycle bin. 405 Method Not Allowed The operation cannot be performed because the user has insufficient access rights, or a condition exists that prevents the operation from being performed.
